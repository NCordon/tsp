# Usage

```python
tsp.py
```
or
```python
tsp.ipynb
```


The comparison has been made taking the same number of iterations for each metaheuristic. The documentation is available in `tsp.tex`, and `presentacion.tex` contains a presentation of results, both in Spanish. The selected operator for getting new solutions has been 2-opt of edges.
